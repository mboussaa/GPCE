\section{Related Work}
Our work is related to iterative compilation research field.
The basic idea of iterative compilation is to explore
the compiler optimization space by measuring the impact of optimizations on softwares performance.
Researches have investigated this optimization problem to catch relevant optimizations regrading performance, energy or code size improvements over standard optimization sequences. The vast majority of the work on iterative compilation focuses on increasing the speedup of new optimized code comparing to standard optimizations. It has been proven that optimizations are highly dependent on target platform and input program. In approach, we present a generic infrastructure that provides more understanding about resource consumption.
