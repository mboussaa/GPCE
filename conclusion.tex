\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we have described a new approach for testing and monitoring code generators families using a container-based infrastructure. 
We used a set of micro-services in order to provide a fine-grained understanding of resource consumption. 
To validate the approach, we applied the proposed approach on an popular family of code generators: HAXE. 
The evaluation results show that we can find real issues in existing code generators. 
In particular, we show that we could find two kinds of errors: the lack of use of a specific function and an abstract type that exist in the standard library of the target language which can reduce the memory usage/execution time of the resulting program.

As a current work, we are discussing with the HAXE community to submit a patch with the first findings. 
We are also conducting the same evaluation for two other code generators families: ThingML and TypeScript. 
As a future work, we are going to improve our understanding on the threshold which can provide a best precision for detecting performance issues in code generators.
